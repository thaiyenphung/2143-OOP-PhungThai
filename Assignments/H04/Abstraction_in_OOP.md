# Part A: Conceptual Questions
## 1. Definition
- **Abstraction** in OOP means focusing on **what an object does, not how does it**. It hides complex internal details and shows only the **essential features and functionality** that users need to interact with.
## **Real-World Analogy**
**A TV Remote**: 
- We press a button to turn it on or change between channels
- We don't need to know how the remote sends signals to the TV or how the electronics work inside
