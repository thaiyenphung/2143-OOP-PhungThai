# Part A: Conceptual Questions
## 1. Definition
- **Polymorphism** allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This enables the same function, method, or operator to behave differently depending on which object calls it. It promotes **code reusability and flexibilty**.
- **Polymorphism** is considered on the **three main pillars** of OOP, alongside **encapsulation and inheritance**. It allows **different objects to respond to the same function call in their own way**. It enables **flexible, reusable, and maintainable code** by letting us write programs that works with general types (like a base class or interface) while allowing **specific behaviior** at runtime.
